# Credit Risk Scoring API with Explainability

## Overview
This project builds an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for credit-risk prediction using tabular data.  
It trains a model, exposes it as an **API via FastAPI**, integrates **SHAP** for explainable AI,  
and uses **CI/CD** through GitHub Actions.
